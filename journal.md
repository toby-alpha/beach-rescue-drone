# Autonomous Beach Rescue Drone

## The Idea
Simply put: Create a prototype for an autonomous drone, that would be able to provide key first-aid rescue across Australia.

## The Current Situation
Australia's extensive coastline is both a national treasure and a significant public safety challenge. The coastline is understandably a popular location for recreation, being a gem of the world. Despite the efforts of Surf Life Saving (SLS) services, many areas remain unmonitored or difficult to patrol. During the 2024-2025 summer period (December to February), **51 coastal drowning deaths** were recorded.

Alarmingly:
- 65% of these drownings occurred more than 1 km away from a patrolled SLS service

- 40% were rip-related beach drownings, with

	-	27% of those involving bystanders attempting to rescue others.

- 60% occurred in regional or rural locations.

These statistics highlight a critical need for an initial rapid-response systems in unpatrolled and remote areas. Response in these areas is currently not feasible with traditional person-based approaches due to a lack of trained people available consistently, and a low amount of people on each beach.

To address this, there is an opportunity to develop an autonomous drone system which could be deployed as part of a system across **every Australian beach**. Especially targeting high-risk and unpatrolled zones.

## What Already Exists
Well.. not much.. really. 

Currently, there exists a solution which is deployed across the country, in which under human control, and deployment, drones are able to make rescues at major beaches. This has proven very effective. Yet, it still leaves a wide part of the country unprotected (60%), thus the need for an autonomous solution arises.

The current solution also allows for shark detection.

## Scope of the Project
**Design and Produce:**
- A mid sized drone (5-7"), based off the FPV framework.
	- The drone is capable of autonomous flight, to a pre-specified location, when directed.

- A solution to allow for the aerial drop of a commercially available inflatable floatation system
- A solution to allow the drone to be weather-proof and protected when not in flight.

**What will *NOT* be included in this scope, yet could be next :**
- Live Rescue tests
- Autonomous vision to detect people in need of assistance.
- Recharging while stored
*This was list was come to in order to ensure safety, and also make the project achievable in under 3 months*
