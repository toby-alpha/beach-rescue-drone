I designed (and will produce) a 7" drone capable of carrying a moderate payload that is a concept for a solution that would  assist in crucial life saving operations.

### Why did I design this?
 
Well... a drone is pretty cool, and my interests as soon as a saw this program definitely came to that straight away. Yet, I wanted to do something more meaningful than just a racing drone, something that could develop as unique, in a needing area. This really sparked my passion, and I feel like I was able to learn alot, while allowing my skills to thrive.

### What next?

Once all the parts arrive, there will be alot of assembly, and wiring to do. I'll be working off the Ardupilot firmware, so when I'm able to, I'll start adding that to the GitHub as well.

I'd love to answer any questions you have about this!

The STEP file contains all the CAD, it is uploaded in a ZIP file. Let me know if there are any errors with the conversions.
